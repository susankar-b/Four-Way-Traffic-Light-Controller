# Four-Way-Traffic-Light-Controller
This project implements a digital traffic signal controller for a four-way road intersection using Verilog HDL, based on Finite State Machine (FSM) design principles. The controller ensures safe and collision-free traffic movement by allowing only one direction (N,S,E,W) to receive a green signal at a time, while all others remain red.
